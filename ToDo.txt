RE4:
        Add a UI system to handle enum flags for `Chainsaw_RandomDrop_DropGroup`.
            (Flags are now supported in generation.)

DD2:
        App_ItemShortcutParameter has item arrays which are generic list wrappers and break the item enum button.
        Via_AnimationCurve is using the new UIntArray container but the UI can't display it.

RE8:
        `app.TPSCameraConditionSetting`1<via.vec3>` generates with a `ObservableCollection<Via_vec3>` from `System.Collections.Generic.List`1<app.TPSCameraConditionSetting`1.Setting<via.vec3>>`.

Show column primitive type below the header text.
    Show the full type name on header hover.
    Add some truncated version of the full name with ellipses so it's at least obvious there's hover text.


Pre-generate properties to breakout enum flags.
Figure out better enum flags parsing. Maybe check for entries that only change one bit.
